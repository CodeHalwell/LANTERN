The LANTERN architecture is a novel approach to language modeling that combines recursive transformers with uncertainty estimation.
It uses sparse attention patterns to reduce computational complexity while maintaining model quality.
The key innovation is the ability to dynamically adjust computation depth based on uncertainty signals.
When the model encounters difficult or ambiguous inputs, it can trigger reasoning mode with deeper recursion.
This allows for efficient inference on easy cases while providing additional computation for hard cases.
The uncertainty estimation combines multiple signals including entropy, semantic dispersion, and epistemic uncertainty.
Bayesian sampling through MC dropout provides a measure of model confidence in its predictions.
The system can inject special THINK tokens to enable chain-of-thought style reasoning when needed.
This makes LANTERN particularly well-suited for tasks requiring both efficiency and careful reasoning.
The recursive transformer architecture enables parameter-efficient scaling through weight sharing across depth.
