The LANTERN architecture is a novel approach to language modeling that combines recursive transformers with uncertainty estimation.
It uses sparse attention patterns to reduce computational complexity while maintaining model quality.
The key innovation is the ability to dynamically adjust computation depth based on uncertainty signals.
When the model encounters difficult or ambiguous inputs, it can trigger reasoning mode with deeper recursion.
This allows for efficient inference on easy cases while providing additional computation for hard cases.
The uncertainty estimation combines multiple signals including entropy, semantic dispersion, and epistemic uncertainty.
Bayesian sampling through MC dropout provides a measure of model confidence in its predictions.
The system can inject special THINK tokens to enable chain-of-thought style reasoning when needed.
This makes LANTERN particularly well-suited for tasks requiring both efficiency and careful reasoning.
The recursive transformer architecture enables parameter-efficient scaling through weight sharing across depth.
In practice, LANTERN is trained on large-scale corpora that include diverse domains such as technical writing, conversational dialogue, and formal reasoning benchmarks.
During pretraining, the model learns to predict the next token while simultaneously estimating its own uncertainty about each prediction, building robust internal confidence signals.
These confidence signals are later used at inference time to decide whether shallow or deep computation is needed for a particular input.
When the uncertainty remains low, the model terminates early, saving computational resources and reducing latency without sacrificing accuracy on simple tasks.
When the uncertainty becomes high, the model allocates more depth, enabling richer internal deliberation over multiple recursive passes.
This dynamic allocation of computation makes LANTERN especially suitable for real-time systems where response time and resource usage must be carefully controlled.
Another important aspect of the LANTERN design is its modular attention mechanism, which separates local pattern recognition from long-range reasoning.
Local attention heads focus on short spans of text to capture syntax, morphology, and nearby semantic relations.
Global attention heads track entities, discourse structure, and cross-sentence dependencies that can span entire documents.
By combining these two views, the model can maintain coherence across long contexts while still being efficient on short ones.
