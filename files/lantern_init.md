# lantern/__init__.py — Public API Surface

This file exposes LANTERN's primary theoretical constructs at package import:

- Re-exports the recursive transformer block, sparse attention, uncertainty metrics, Bayesian sampler, and controllers, presenting a cohesive interface for **uncertainty-aware generation**.
- The module docstring frames LANTERN's pillars—recursive depth, MC-dropout Bayesian sampling, uncertainty-triggered special tokens, and sparse attention—highlighting the theoretical integration of efficiency and calibrated reasoning.

By centralizing imports, it encourages users to think of these components as a unified toolkit for entropy-guided reasoning.
